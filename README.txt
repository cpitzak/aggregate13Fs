13F Aggregator to aid investment decisions

This app aggregates and creates a text report of 13Fs of famous guru investors. I use it to discover new stock for potential investment.

Technical Details:
This is not a critical app, so most Exceptions have not been handled. In case a Network/Internet call fails, the script can be re-run once connection is restored.
